      <cite>Machine Learning</cite> (ML) is the computerized approach to analyzing computational work that is based on
      both a set of theories and a set of technologies. And, being a very active area of research and development, there
      is not a single agreed-upon definition that would satisfy everyone, but there are some aspects, which would be
      part of any knowledgeable person’s definition.

   <h4><mark>Definition </mark> Ability of a machine to improve its own performance through the use of a software that
      employs artificial intelligence techniques to mimic the ways by which humans seem to learn, such as repetition and
      experience.

   <h2 style="color:aliceblue">The Goals of Machine Learning:</h2>
   <p>(1) To make the <i>computers smarter, more intelligent</i>. The more direct objective in this aspect is to develop
      systems (programs) for specific practical learning tasks in application domains.<br>
      (2) To develop computational models of human learning process and perform computer simulations. The study in this
      aspect is also called <u>cognitive modeling</u>.<br>
      (3) To explore new learning methods and develop general learning algorithms independent of applications.

   <div id="aim">
      <h2 style="color:aliceblue">The Aim of Machine Learning:</h2>
      <p>The field of machine learning can be organized around three primary research Areas:
         • <mark>Task-Oriented Studies</mark>: The development and analysis of learning systems oriented toward solving
         a predetermined set, of tasks (also known as the “engineering approach”).
         • <mark></mark>: The investigation and computer simulation of human learning processes (also known as the
         “cognitive modeling approach”)
      <h2 style="color:aliceblue">Machine Learning as a Science:</h2>
      <p>The clear contender for a cognitive invariant in human is the<b>learning mechanism</b> which is the ability
         facts, skills and more abstractive concepts. Therefore understanding human learning well enough to reproduce
         aspect of that learning behavior in a computer system is, in itself, a worthy scientific goal. Moreover,<u>the
            computer can render substantial assistance to cognitive psychology</u> , in that it may be used to test the
         consistency and completeness of learning theories and enforce a commitment to the fine-structure process level
         detail that precludes meaningless tautological or untestable theories (Bishop, 2006).
         The study of human learning processes is also of considerable practical significance. Gaining insights into the
         principles underlying human learning abilities is likely to lead to more effective educational techniques.
         Machine learning research is all about developing intelligent computer assistant or <del>a computer tutoring
            systems and many of these goals are shared within the machine learning fields</del>. According to Jaime et
         al who stated computer tutoring are starting to incorporate abilities to infer models of student competence
         from observed performance. Inferring the scope of a student’s knowledge and skills in a particular area allows
         much more effective and individualized tutoring of the student.

         <h2 style="color:aliceblue">Applications of Machine Learning in day-to-day life:</h2>
         <p>Now that you get the hang of it, you might be asking what are some of the examples of machine learning and
            how does it affect our life? Unless you have been living under a rock – your life is already heavily
            impacted by machine learning.

            Let us look at a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already:

            Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves
            Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested
            in
            Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history
            Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time
            The applications of machine learning are immense. You can read this article for a comprehensive list of
            applications driven by machine learning, which we use in our day-to-day life</p>

      <div id="attention">
         <h2 style="color:aliceblue">Why is Machine Learning getting so much attention recently?</h2>
         <p>Sounds exciting! But this idea of teaching machines has been around for a while. Remember Asimov’s Three
            Laws of robotics? Machine Learning ideas and research have been around for decades. However, there has been
            a lot of action and buzz recently.

            The obvious question is why is this happening now when machine learning has been around for several decades?

            This development is driven by a few underlying forces:

            The amount of data generation is increasing significantly with a reduction in the cost of sensors (Force 1)
            Every time you take an action on any website, including Facebook and YouTube – you create data for these
            companies
            All connected devices including fitness bands, smartwatches, and connected equipment are generating data</p>
      </div>
      <div id="automation">
         <h2 style="color:aliceblue">How is machine learning different from automation?</h2>
         <p>If you are thinking that <u>machine learning is nothing but a new name of automation </u>– you would be
            wrong.

            Most of the automation which has happened in the last few decades has been rule-driven automation. For
            example – automating flows in our mailbox needs us to define the rules. These rules act in the same manner
            every time. On the other hand, machine learning helps machines learn by past data and change their
            decisions/performance accordingly.

            Spam detection in our mailboxes is driven by machine learning. Hence, it continues to evolve with time.

            The only relation between the two things is that machine learning enables better automation.</p>
